# Simon-Game

The game works by pressing any key to start and it will show you a tile that you have to click on. As you go from level to level, the patterns get more and more complicated, and at some point you're going to screw up, and it's going to tell you that youâ€™ve got it wrong and the game is over.
Play the Simon Game and have fun, so you can press any key to restart the game.
